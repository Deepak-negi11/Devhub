    excerpt:
      "Losing does not mean you are unsuccessful. Every setback is a lesson, and failure is just a stepping stone to success. Elon Musk faced multiple failures—Tesla was near bankruptcy, SpaceX had rocket crashes, and many doubted his visions. Yet, he persisted, learned, and adapted. True success lies in resilience, the ability to rise after falling. Winners are not those who never fail, but those who never give up. Losing is temporary, but quitting makes it permanent. Keep pushing forward, embrace failures, and use them as fuel to achieve greatness—just like Musk did.",
